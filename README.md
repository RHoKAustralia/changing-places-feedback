- Project: Changing Places
- Winter Hackathon, June 2016

Disabled users and their carers need to suggest locations for new specialized toilet facilities.

The code here implements a micro-site for them. Intended to be a highly-functional mockup for later porting into WordPress.

If that fails, we can deploy this online elsewhere and link/iframe it within the main site.
